HAKATHON project is a web portal which is developed or implemented in java domain or platform. This project is helpful for students, companies or any organization
to conduct any examinations from this site. In this age of increased competition, various companies, organization’s face a common problem of conducting online exam 
by personally visiting to different colleges (in case of companies) for placement drives. Manually going through thousands of colleges and conducting interviews
requires a lot of time, efforts and money, this is the reason that most of the companies prefer visiting only top most colleges. The students of low-grade colleges
despite of having the caliber to compete are not getting enough exposure to job profiles of their choices and end up getting a low satisfying job. To reduce this 
gap between these companies or any organization and such potential candidates this platform will help the deserving candidates to showcase their conceptual skills 
through an online exam, based on which, the companies can filter out candidates according to their needs. Basically, we are providing an online exam system where 
we host exams to create report of candidates which can be viewed by the companies. This will not only help the companies or any organization to analyze and select
the cream candidates which meet company’s requirements but also, help the students to get exposure to enough companies.
